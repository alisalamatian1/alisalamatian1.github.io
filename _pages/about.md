I am Ali Salamatian, a 5th-year Computer Science Honours student at the University of British Columbia, researching multimodal models. Currently, I'm working on two projects: efficient video patch selection (supervised by [Prof. Leonid Sigal](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lsigal/) and [Prof. Evan Shelhamer](https://imaginarynumber.net/)), and enhancing vision-language-action models with MCTS (supervised by [Prof. Cyrus Neary](https://www.cyrusneary.com/)).

Previously, I collaborated with [Prof. Giuseppe Carenini](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~carenini) and [Prof. Leonid Sigal](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lsigal/) on ChartGaze, aligning LVLMs' attention with human gaze, published at EMNLP 2025.

I really enjoy multimodal research and collaborating with others so feel free to reach out if you have any interesting ideas!
